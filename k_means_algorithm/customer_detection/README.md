# Overview

** This project uses the K-Means clustering algorithm to analyze mall customer data, focusing on their annual income and spending score. The goal is to group customers into clusters based on their spending behavior. **


## Requirements

Python 3.x

Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, sklearn


### Steps to Run the Code


-Import Libraries: 
-Make sure to import the necessary libraries at the beginning of your script:
-Load the dataset using pandas:

-Check the shape and basic info of the dataset:

-Create a scatter plot to visualize the relationship between annual income and spending score:


-Use the Elbow method to find the optimal number of clusters:

-Based on the Elbow method, determine the number of clusters (e.g., 5) and fit the K-Means model:

-Scatter plot to visualize the clusters:

-Repeat the clustering process using Age and Spending Score:
   - Use the Elbow method to find clusters for Age.
   - Fit K-Means and visualize the results.
